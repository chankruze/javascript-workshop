    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chankruze/javascript-workshop.git
    ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Task Submission

- Ensure your task is placed in the appropriate directory within the "Tasks" folder.
- Include a clear and concise task description in the task file.
- If applicable, provide hints or additional information in the task file.
- In case if a problem requires multiple files (i.e. html, css and javascript files) then you must create a folder following the issue's description.
- Don't name a folder with white sapces. Always use `your-folder-name` pattern for naming your folders.
- I will enforce linting and formatting rules to the repo but if in case your code is not formatted properly then use [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to format your code before commiting.
- Use popular text editors like vs code, sublime or atom instead of using notepad.

### Javascript Specific

- Try to add comments in javascript code.
- Try to give meaningful names to the variables you declare.
- Follow `camelCase` for variable name declaration.
- Use `UPPERCASE` for naming constants.

### Code Quality

- Follow best practices and maintain a consistent coding style.
- Add comments to explain complex sections of your code.
- Ensure your code is readable and well-documented.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Each pull request should address a single task or improvement.
- Reference the relevant issue number in your pull request description.
- Keep pull requests focused and avoid making unrelated changes.
- Be open to feedback and make necessary changes promptly.

### Communication

- Join our [Discussions](https://github.com/chankruze/javascript-workshop/discussions) for general questions or to propose new ideas.
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/chankruze/javascript-workshop/issues) for bug reports, feature requests, or discussions on broader topics.
